## meta files for SGE pipeline

* `sge.yaml` contains the definition for a conda environment that will allow you to run the various scripts and programs in the pipeline.  Assuming you have a working `conda` installation already (not covered here), run `conda env create -f sge.yaml` to create the environment named `sge`.  Once the environment has been created, run `conda activate sge` to activate and use the environment.  Note that this `activate` command needs to be run every time you login to use the SGE pipeline (or set up to be run automatically); it is NOT a one-time command.
